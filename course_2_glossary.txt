IT Automation with Python________________________________________
Terms and definitions from Course 2
A
Absolute path: A full path to the resource in the file system
Alteration: RegEx that matches any one of the alternatives separated by the pipe symbol
Automatic testing: A process where software checks itself for errors and confirms that it works correctly
B
Backreference: This is applied when using re.sub() to substitute the value of a capture group into the output
Bash: The most commonly used shell on Linux
Bash script: A script that contains multiple commands
Black-box tests: A test where there is an awareness of what the program is supposed to do but not how it does it
C
Character classes: These are written inside square brackets and let us list the characters we want to match inside of those brackets
Character ranges: Ranges used to match a single character against a set of possibilities
Comma separated values (CSV): A very common data format used to store data as segment of text separated by commas
Command line arguments: Inputs provided to a program when running it from the command line
Compiled or compiled language: Supportable code that can be executed on different platforms
Cut: A command that can split and take only bits of each line using spaces
D
Dialects: Rules that define how a CSV file is structured
E
Edge cases: Inputs to code that produce unexpected results, found at the extreme ends of the ranges of input
Environment variables: Settings and data stored outside a program that can be accessed by it to alter how the program behaves in a particular environment
F
File systems: Methods and structures used to organize and control how data is stored and accessed
G
Globs: Characters that create list of files, like the star and question mark 
grep: An especially easy to use yet extremely powerful tool for applying RegExes
I
Input / Output (I/O): These streams are the basic mechanism for performing input and output operations in your programs
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): A code editor with extra capabilities to simplify script writing
Interpreter or interpreted language: An intermediary program used to execute the instructions specified in the code
K
Kernel: The main core of an operating system that talks directly to hardware and manages the system’s resource
L
Linux: An open source operating system where the software is free to share, modify, and distribute
Log files: Log files are records or text files that store a history of events, actions, or errors generated by a computer system, software, or application for diagnostic, troubleshooting, or auditing purposes
Lookahead: RegEx that matches a pattern only if it’s followed by another pattern
M
Mac OS: Operating system developed by Apple
Mode: The format controlling what you can do with a recently opened file
O
Operating system (OS): Software that manages everything that goes on in the computer, composed of two main parts: the kernel and the user space
P
Pipes: A process of connecting the output of one program to the input of another
Piping: A process of connecting multiple scripts, commands, or other programs together into a data processing pipeline
Pytest: A powerful Python testing tool that assists programmers in writing more effective and stable programs
Q
Qwiklabs: An online learning environment or virtual machine to simulate real-world scenarios
R
Reader objects:  Object that represents an element or entity within a scene that needs to be rendered to the screen
Redirection: A process of sending a stream to a different destination
Regular expression: A search query for text that's expressed by string pattern, also known as RegEx or RegExp
Relative path: A portion of a path to show where the resource is located in relation to the current working directory
S
Signals: Tokens delivered to running processes to indicate a desired action
Software testing: A process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or not it does what is expected
Standard input stream commonly (STDIN): A channel between a program and a source of input
Standard output stream (STDOUT): A pathway between a program and a target of output, like a display
Standard error (STDERR): This displays output like standard out, but is used specifically as a channel to show error messages and diagnostics from the program
Shell: The application that reads and executes all commands 
Subprocesses: A process to call and run other applications from within Python, including other Python scripts
T
Test case: This is the individual unit of testing that looks for a specific response to a set of inputs
Test fixture: This prepared to perform one or more tests
Test suite: This is used to compile tests that should be executed together
Test runner: This runs the test and provides developers with the outcome’s data
U
unittest: A set of Python tools to construct and run unit tests
Unit tests: A test to verify that small isolated parts of a program work correctly
User space: Everything outside of the kernel that users interact with directly
V
Virtual environment: A tool that allows you to create isolated environments for your Python projects
Virtual machine (VM): A computer simulated through software
W
White-box test: A test where test creator knows how the code works and can write test cases that use the understanding to make sure it performs as expected
Wildcard: A character that can match more than one character
Windows OS: Operating system developed by Microsoft
Writer objects: The capability to write data to a CSV file
