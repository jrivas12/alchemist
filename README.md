## 📚 About This Project

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm **Joe Rivas**, and this repository is a monument to my belief that code should *teach*, not just execute. My journey into C++ wasn’t about finding the quickest path to a job — it was about diving deep into the machine, understanding the gears, and mastering the craft. I thrive on the challenge of making the complex explicit. For years, I’ve seen students struggle with opaque codebases. This project is my counter-argument — a dedication to unapologetically verbose, cleanly structured programs that let you **trace the logic on a Sunday afternoon**. From mastering recursion to visualizing stack and queue dynamics in the terminal, every line here is a lesson in rigor. If you’re a developer who values **clarity over convention**, **design over shortcuts**, and believes that **fundamentals are the true measure of craftsmanship**, then this space is for you.  
Clone it, explore it, and let’s work on the hard problems — together.

## 🗂️ What’s Inside (Selected Highlights)

| **Program / Lab** | **Description** | **Files** |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Polyhedra Stack/Queue Lab** | Flat-file ingestion of geometric solids structured into containers. Traversed twice — once via stack, once via queue — to visualize order. | `polyhedra_Stack_Queue.cpp`, `polyhedra.txt` |
| **Kirchhoff’s Circuit Law (Lab 6)** | Interactive solver that computes current values with ANSI-colored precision using `setprecision` for formatted output. | `kirchhoffs_Law_Calculator.cpp` |
| **Student Records Sorter** | Imports student data, applies **MergeSort** and **QuickSort** for GPA ranking, outputs tabular results. | `records_sorter.cpp`, `Student.h`, `Student.cpp` |
| **Essay Analyzer** | Tokenizes and counts text, mapping adjacency for low-level linguistic analysis and data structure integration. | `poem_fstream.cpp`, `essay.txt` |
| **Collatz Sequence Analyzer** | Recursive, colorized sequence trace — demonstrates call depth and algorithmic rhythm. | `menu_Orchestrator.cpp` *(Option 2)* |
| **Array Grades (C)** | C fundamentals revisited: compute `min`, `max`, and `avg` with raw arrays and pointer arithmetic. | `array_grades.c` |
| **Sales Linear Regression** | Calculates slope, intercept, and projections from console input — ASCII-aligned output. | `sales_linear_regression.cpp` |
| **Color Mixer** | Conditional logic visualized through color theory — primary hues form composites, logic as art. | `color_mixer.cpp` |
| **Tortoise vs. Hare (ASCII Race)** | Demonstrates Object-Oriented Design (inheritance) through a timed, text-based simulation. | `Tortoise.h`, `Hare.h`, `tortoise_hare_race.cpp` |
| **Main Menu Orchestrator** | Central CLI hub unifying algorithms, I/O utilities, and interactive numeric tools. | `menu_Orchestrator.cpp`, `ArrayStats.h`, `InsertionSort.h`, `SelectionSort.h` |

## 💡 Why This Repository Is Different

- 🎓 *Academic lens, practitioner’s rigor:* forward declarations, operator-aware design, indentation as grammar.  
- 🧠 *Fundamentals first:* data structures, I/O, and algorithms — before frameworks and shortcuts.  
- 🔍 *Deliberately visible complexity:* recursion, sorting behavior, and data flow shown, not hidden.  
- ❤️ *It’s mine:* you can fork the code, but not the years of curiosity and discipline behind it.

## 👥 Who This Is For

- 👔 **Technical Recruiters & Hiring Managers** evaluating **C/C++ competency**.  
- 💻 **Engineers** seeking examples of **foundational algorithms** and low-level data handling.  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Instructors / TAs** needing **fully functional, pedagogically rigorous** C++ demonstrations.

Thank you for reviewing this portfolio.  
I look forward to discussing how my attention to detail and deep C++ foundation can serve your team or classroom.
