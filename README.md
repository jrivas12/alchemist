## 📚 About This Project  

This is my dedicated **C++ stronghold** — where fundamentals get stress-tested, recursion earns its keep, and verbosity is a feature, not a bug.  

I don’t toss snippets over the wall; I build coherent, runnable programs with mains, headers, forward declarations, and disciplined indentation that actually teach.  
If you’re here for quick hacks, keep walking.  
If you’re here to see **C++ worked like a craft**, pull up a chair.  

I work native down to ASCII: clear terminals, ANSI color, deterministic output. I prefer explicitness over mystery, and I’ll expose internals if it helps the next student climb faster.  
Clone the repo and run it.  
You’ll get more than results — you’ll get reasoning.

## 🗂️ What’s Inside (Selected Highlights)

- **Polyhedra Lab** — CSV/flat-file ingestion into structured records; tabular reporting with `setw`, and side-by-side stack vs. queue traversals to make data-structure order visible.  
  *Files:* `polyhedra.txt`, Polyhedra model, Stack/Queue demos.

- **Kirchhoff’s Circuit Law (Lab 6)** — Interactive solver with colorized terminal output, precise `setprecision`, and a straight path from input → formulation → currents `I1`, `I2`.  
  *Files:* `kirchhoffs_Law_Calculator.cpp`

- **Essay Analyzer** — Text ingestion → tokenization → frequency and adjacency checks, with interactive prompts so learners can iterate fast.  
  *Files:* `essay.txt` + analyzer program.

- **Array Grades (C)** — Minimalist C array analytics for `min` / `max` / `average`; a reminder that pointer-level thinking still matters in 2025.  
  *Files:* classic multi-dimensional array patterns.

- **Tortoise vs. Hare (ASCII Race)** — Timed simulation, ANSI art, and a clean separation of state vs. render. Deterministic enough to reason about; theatrical enough to remember.  
  *Files:* `Tortoise.h`, `Hare.h`, race driver.

- **Main Menu Orchestrator** — A hub that wires in templated `ArrayStats`, Insertion/Selection/Quick/Merge sort paths, and utilities like password generation and randomized doubles.  
  *Files:* `ArrayStats.h`, `InsertionSort.h`, `SelectionSort.h`, `records_sorter.h`, program options 1–4.

## 🚀 Why This Repo Is Different  

- 🎓 *Academic lens, practitioner’s rigor:* forward declarations, operator-aware design, indentation as grammar, verbose logs for teachability.  
- 🧠 *Fundamentals first:* data structures, I/O, formatting, and algorithmic thinking before toys and frameworks.  
- 🔎 *Deliberately visible complexity:* recursion, selection strategies, queue/stack order, and numeric routines are shown, not hidden.  
- ❤️ *It’s mine:* you can clone the source; you can’t clone the years of dedicated passion that shaped it.

## 👥 Who This Is For  

- 📝 Students who want examples that compile, communicate, and explain.  
- 🧑‍🏫 TAs/instructors who need compact demos that show stack/queue order, sort behavior, or numerical pipelines.  
- 🖥️ Curious devs who appreciate explicit style and clean terminal output.
