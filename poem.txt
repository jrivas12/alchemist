There once was a person named and giving
Give way too much because they love people deeply
but nobody treated them as such.
Giving started to feel empty giving had little left to give
And giving started to feel like they would never fully live
Giving met Taking but Giving didn't know how to let go
And Giving lost everything but never really let it show 
Taking eventually left, taking everything it could
And Taking never look back, even when Giving hope that they would 
Giving sat down at a bench where Giving met Time
And Time told Giving everything's going to be just fine
Giving sat there for a while waiting for someone new
And Giving started to wonder if someone was waiting for them to 
Giving eventually stood up they walked around the block
Where Giving saw somebody who was sitting next to a clock 
Giving new time but they didn't want to interrupt to greet 
so giving kept walking is that someone stood from their seat 
giving wondered about them but giving was afraid 
because Giving had always given but that love had never stayed 
but Committing wasn't afraid and Committing knew how to give 
so Committing ran up to Giving and taught them him to forgive. 
Committing meant giving and introduced them to receiving 
and Giving became so abundant they forgot they ever knew leaving.
