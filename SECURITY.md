## 🧭 About This Policy  

I take the **security of this C++ repository** as seriously as its readability.  
This isn’t just source code — it’s a reflection of engineering ethics, and that includes the responsibility to protect users and contributors from harm.  

If you’ve found a vulnerability, I thank you.  
A clear, responsible report helps keep the foundation strong for every developer who learns from it.
