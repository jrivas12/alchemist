## 🧭 About This Policy  

I take the **security of this C++ repository** as seriously as its readability.  
This isn’t just source code — it’s a reflection of engineering ethics, and that includes the responsibility to protect users and contributors from harm.  

If you’ve found a vulnerability, I thank you.  
A clear, responsible report helps keep the foundation strong for every developer who learns from it.  

---

## 🧱 Supported Versions  

The following versions are actively maintained with **security updates** and general improvements.  
Older branches may still build, but they’re considered **out of scope** for security patches.  

| Version | Supported |
|----------|------------|
| **5.1.x** | :white_check_mark: |
| **5.0.x** | :x: |
| **4.0.x** | :white_check_mark: |
| **< 4.0** | :x: |

## 🧩 What to Include  

To help us triage and validate the report effectively, please provide as much detail as possible:

- **Vulnerability Details:** A clear description of the issue (e.g., buffer overflow, race condition, logic flaw).  
- **Affected Component:** Specific filename(s), such as `kirchhoffs_Law_Calculator.cpp` or `polyhedra.h`.  
- **Reproduction Steps:** Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the problem.  
- **Impact:** Describe what an attacker could achieve by exploiting the issue.  
- **Suggested Fix (Optional):** Proposed patch or mitigation strategy, if available.

## 🕒 Our Response Process  

Once a report is received, you can expect the following stages and response times:  

| Stage | Expected Response Time |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Acknowledgement** (Initial confirmation of receipt) | Within **48 hours** |
| **Triage & Status Update** (Severity assessment and reproduction) | Within **7 days** |
| **Patch Release / Decision** (If validated) | Typically **14–30 days**, depending on complexity |

If the issue is verified, we’ll issue a **patched release** and follow a **responsible disclosure** process.  
Credit will be given in advisories and release notes unless anonymity is requested.

## 🧠 Scope & Out-of-Scope  

**In Scope:**  
- Core logic errors, memory mismanagement, or unvalidated user input.  
- Vulnerabilities that lead to undefined behavior or privilege escalation.  

**Out of Scope:**  
- Compiler or library bugs beyond project control.  
- Educational or demonstration programs intentionally simplified for teaching.  
- Issues requiring administrative or physical access to the runtime system.
